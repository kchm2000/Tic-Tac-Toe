Kent's Tic Tac Toe game

Please intsall python 3 to run my simple 2 player Tic Tac Toe command line game.

The game file is split into 2. The Main2.py file is where the main coding is and the Functions.py holds the functions used in the Main2.py

The game will ask you how many games you want to play when you start. Next you have to input the coordinates into the command line. There are validations to ensure that the inputs are correct before the system accepts user inputs. When all games have finished a grand total score will be tabulated to see if which user has won or whether its a draw.
